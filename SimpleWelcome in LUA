-- This is a simple script that prints a welcome message when a player joins the server

-- Event handler for player joining
AddEventHandler('playerConnecting', function(playerName, setKickReason, deferrals)
    -- Print welcome message
    print('Player ' .. playerName .. ' is connecting')

    -- Display a welcome message to the player
    deferrals.defer()

    -- Simulate some checks or data retrieval before allowing the player to join
    Citizen.Wait(2000) -- Wait for 2 seconds (you can replace this with your own checks)

    -- Allow the player to join
    deferrals.update('Welcome to the server!')

    -- Perform additional checks or data retrieval if needed
    Citizen.Wait(1000) -- Wait for 1 second (replace this with your own checks)

    -- Finally, allow the player to fully join
    deferrals.done('Welcome to the server! Have fun!')
end)
